# Software Requirements Specification Document

Version 2
This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and be sure that your group has a `main` branch with this document and the entire [template repository codebase](https://github.com/david-gary/onlineStoreTemplate) either forked or downloaded and copied into your group's repository. If you have arranged to use a different codebase as a template, you do not need to have the original template included, but a `main` branch is still required.

## Introduction


The idea for our project is to create a hands on jewlery store. We will build a system that has features to be able to search for jewlery based on the type and the material. The software system will allow users to perform filtered searches, create a wishlist or shopping cart for any items, and it will also display every item and give a brief description of it. Our stakeholders are the individual customers that are interested in buying products from our store. Their needs are the products we offer and we will give them the ability to browse through to find the right item to fit their needs.
the filter search is when a user can input certain things that they are looking for and not looking for (based on price, material, type) and will find items that match the conditions they have set in the search.

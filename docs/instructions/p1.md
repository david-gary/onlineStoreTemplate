# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Revisions

When a change is made to the document, a new revision should be created. The revision should be added to the table below with all information filled out.

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **REQ-1**
  - **Making sure that users can place orders.**
  - **Functional**
  - **1**
  - **It is fundamental to the user actually getting their order.**
  - **By placing an order.**
- **REQ-2**
  - **It should be aesthetically pleasing.**
  - **Non-functional**
  - **3**
  - **I believe looks are very important for any products success.**
  - **Perhaps by asking third-parties if they find it pretty.**
- **REQ-3**
  - **Inventory tracking**
  - **Functional**
  - **2**
  - **The cafe must know when something is in high demand, or completely out of stock**
  - **By placing an order and verifying that it subtracted from the inventory.**

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.
- **We must push an update at least once a week**
- **We must complete the assignment by 11:59 PM on August 7th, 2023.**

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **UC-1**
  - **To order coffee from a cafe**
  - **Customer, barista**
  - **The user must have money in their digital wallet, and the cafe must have coffee in stock.**
  - **Cafe must have the user's money, and the user must have placed their order.**
  - **UC-2**
  - **Cancelling a placed order**
  - **customer, barista** 
  - **The user must have already placed an order, and it must not be complete.**
  - **The order is cancelled and the customer has their money back.**

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **US-1**
  - **Customer**
  - **A user places an order, goes to the cafe, and picks it up.**
  - **US-2**
  - **Customer**
  - **A user no longer wishes to pick up their order and cancels it through the system.** 
## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- **Update**
  - **A new version of our system that seeks to improve the functionality and user experience.**

## Submission Details

- On Canvas, submit the following:
  - The URL to your group's GitHub repository, with the latest version of your code pushed to the `main` branch.

# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

<!-- In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section. -->

For this project we will be creating a website for a coffee shop. This will provide the coffee shop with an online presence and accept orders and payments through the site. The system we are building will provide users with images, descriptions, prices, and customizations of coffee drinks.

## Constraints

<!-- In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative. -->

Constaints include:
-The time available for completing the project
-The backend software used for developing the graphics and visuals for the website is limited to python


**Timeline:** 
Must be done withing the next month, with options that incorperate most if not all the priority 1 requirements.

**Working as a Team:** Working as a team can be constraining because each team member has their own schedule, lives, and responsibilities outside of this project. Finding a good time to work together or even talk together at the same time in the group chat can be difficult. 



## Use Cases

  - **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed.

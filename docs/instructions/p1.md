# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

For this group project, we will be developing and implementing an online cafe that meets the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the following sections. Our shareholders will primarily be members of the under-thirty crowd who are comfortable with technology and e-commerce.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **REQ-1**
  - **Making sure that users can place orders.**
  - **Functional**
  - **1**
  - **It is fundamental to the user actually getting their order.**
  - **By placing an order.**
- **REQ-2**
  - **It should be aesthetically pleasing.**
  - **Non-functional**
  - **3**
  - **I believe looks are very important for any products success.**
  - **Perhaps by asking third-parties if they find it pretty.**
- **REQ-3**
  - **Inventory tracking**
  - **Functional**
  - **2**
  - **The cafe must know when something is in high demand, or completely out of stock**
  - **By placing an order and verifying that it subtracted from the inventory.**
- **REQ-4**
  - **Making sure user can view orders.**
  - **Functional**
  - **2**
  - **It is fundamental to the user to be able to check that their order is correct before paying**
  - **By viewing an order**
- **REQ-5**
  - **Allowing users to cancel their entire order.**
  - **Functional**
  - **2**
  - **It is fundamental to the user to cancel their order if they change their mind.**
  - **By canceling/removing an order.**

  - **Functional**
  - **2**
  - **It is fundamental to the user to edit their order if they choose.**
  - **By editing an order after 'view order'.**
- **REQ-7**
    - **The web application will have a secure and smooth login functionality.**
    - **Functional**
    - **Priority: 2**
    - **Login and logout functionality allows users to have the product securely accessed without outside interference.**
    - **Automated tests can be used to ensure that users can successfully login and logout.**
- **REQ-8**
  - **The application will successfully utilize a SQL database to store product information.**
  - **Functional**
  - **Priority: 4**
  - **SQL databases are an efficient way to store information about numerous and diverse products.**
  - **The database can be tested by inserting and deleting items, as well as testing edge cases.**


## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

- **We must push an update at least once a week**
- **We must complete the assignment by 11:59 PM on August 7th, 2023.**
- **We must meet at least once weekly in discord**
- **We must hold each other accountable for our work**
- **There is a limited amount of computational power available, so computationally intensive actions will not be available.**
- **The platform will be constrained to a web applicaition, multi-platform functionality is not possible.**

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **UC-1**
  - **To order coffee from a cafe**
  - **Customer, barista**
  - **The user must have money in their digital wallet, and the cafe must have coffee in stock.**
  - **Cafe must have the user's money, and the user must have placed their order.**
